# This hook script checks if a file has MKV extension and is already encoded to H265/x265. If all the conditions match, bypass it
# processing by just moving the file to the handbrake output folder. Not quite the brilliant solution, for it's just checking the
# encoding in the file name which is not the proper way. Still trying to figure it out how to add MediaInfo inside the HandBrake
# container to check it using the right tools.
